## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
The migration file `0031_kpi_tracking_system.sql` now includes:
- 4 SQL INSERT statements
- Each statement uses PostgreSQL `unnest()` arrays
- 200 report names
- 200 report descriptions
- 200 KPI code arrays
- All marked as `is_global = true`

### Report Structure
Each global report includes:
- **Name**: Descriptive report title
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of what the report tracks
- **KPI Codes**: Array containing the single KPI code for focused reporting
- **Category**: One of 5 main categories
- **Global Flag**: Set to `true` for universal access

## Benefits of Individual Reports

1. **Focused Analytics**: Each report dedicated to a single metric
2. **Easy Discovery**: Find reports by KPI code or name
3. **Simplified Tracking**: Clear 1:1 mapping between KPIs and reports
4. **Scalable**: Add custom reports without affecting global library
5. **Performance**: Optimized queries for single-KPI analysis

## Usage

### Access All Reports
```typescript
import { getKPIReports } from '@ghxstship/config/analytics-client';

const allReports = await getKPIReports(supabase, undefined, true);
// Returns all 200 global reports
```

### Filter by Category
```typescript
const financialReports = await getKPIReports(supabase, 'FINANCIAL_PERFORMANCE', true);
// Returns 45 financial reports
```

### Get Specific Report
```sql
SELECT * FROM kpi_reports 
WHERE is_global = true 
AND 'FIN_REV_001' = ANY(kpi_codes);
```

## Verification

Run this query to confirm all 200 reports are created:

```sql
SELECT 
  category,
  COUNT(*) as report_count
FROM kpi_reports
WHERE is_global = true
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY category;

-- Expected Results:
